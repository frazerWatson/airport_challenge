# Makers Academy week 2 project challenge.

The airport_challenge program is supposed to replicate an air traffic control system which allows incoming planes to land and then take off again. I have set the initial airport capacity to 10, so no more planes will be able to land until the others takeoff from the airport. If the weather is too stormy to fly, planes will not be permitted to land or take off.

There is only one airport in my example. Need to seperate out concerns and create multiple airports.
